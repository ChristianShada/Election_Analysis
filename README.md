## Election-Audit Results
Thank you for using this script for your analysis. It will prove very helpful for your results and where your results were contived of. What is important here is that you may use this code interchangibly. As so long as your initial data source is consistant with the data set initially stated. Th code can then grab the specifics and help find your winner. It is also important that you would change the titles based on how you would want them to read. 
- For instance, if you are trying to run a marketing campaign and you want to know which of the three top campaigns would suite your needs best, or grab the most poeple in your focus group. You would want to title each of the campaigns and commnit them to a smaller focus group. Once you have receieved the data you could insert the same datat into the excel document that was firt provided. Change out any titles you'd like i.e. Largest County Turnout
